This folder contains documentation and screenshots for my third website version, created using WordPress manually installed on an AWS EC2 instance. The site was configured with SSL using Certbot and linked to a DuckDNS domain. Despite some challenges with image uploads, database credentials, and the browser showing “Not Secure,” I successfully resolved the issues by fixing file permissions and reconfiguring setup details. This version demonstrates my understanding of CMS-based development, server setup, file ownership, and basic cybersecurity practices.
Started with a custom HTML website using a template from HTML5 UP.

Manually edited HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to personalize the layout.

Faced challenges adding images and customizing sections to fit my store style.

Decided to create a new store using WordPress for easier editing and better image handling.

Installed WordPress manually on the same AWS EC2 instance using terminal commands.

Configured WordPress in a subdirectory (/wordpress) so it wouldn’t overwrite my HTML site.

Installed and configured SSL certificate with Certbot + Let's Encrypt.

Linked the site to my DuckDNS domain and tested HTTPS (Not Secure warning due to DuckDNS, expected).

Fixed file permission issues to allow image uploads through WordPress.

Customized the WordPress theme and uploaded new product images.

Documented the whole process with screenshots and written explanations.

Organized all files into folders on GitHub for submission and clarity.
