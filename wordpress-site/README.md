This was the initial version of my online jewelry store, developed using the WordPress content management system (CMS). It reflects my early experimentation with web development and interface design. Key highlights include:

 CMS Installation: WordPress was installed and configured to operate on an AWS EC2 instance running Apache.

Theme Customization: I applied and modified a pre-existing theme to suit the visual identity of the jewelry brand.

 Media & Product Integration: Images and product details were uploaded and organized using WordPress' built-in media tools and product layout blocks.

Ease of Use & Learning Outcome: This version allowed me to understand the basics of site structure, page building, and content management through a no-code environment.

Evaluation: Although it was the easiest to set up, it lacked the technical depth I achieved in later versions, which is why I rebuilt the project from scratch to demonstrate manual configuration skills.

This store serves as the foundation of my project journey, showcasing how I progressed from visual site builders to custom HTML and server-level control.
